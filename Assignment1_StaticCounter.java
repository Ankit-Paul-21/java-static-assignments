/* Assignment 1: Static Counter
Create a class Book with a non-static field title and a static field libraryCount.

In Bookâ€™s constructor, increment libraryCount.

Write a static method getLibraryCount() to return how many Book objects have been created.

In main(), create several Book instances and print out the count. */
